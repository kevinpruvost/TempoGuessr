## Background Story & Description

In a world where scientists are performing more and more tests on Time Travelling technologies. A group of scientists decided to try to educate
some monkeys to make them the test subjects of their experiences on Time Travelling technologies.
In order to prepare them for time travels, these scientists had to teach them how to, at least, recognize their environment and the timeline they are located in.

</p>

To do that, they called us, a bunch of weird devs, to make applications to teach them how to recognize environments and timelines based only on visual informations.

We, then, made two applications, a web one and a mobile one.

## How to train your timeline recognition

You can download the [Mobile Application (Android)](https://github.com/EpitechIT2020/G-JAM-001-NCY-0-1-jam-kevin.pruvost/blob/master/Builds/final.apk) or go on the [Web Application]().

The goal is pretty simple, you will have to pick images of the same location in the right order and guess in what timeline they are.
The more you'll have right answers, the more you'll be able not to get lost in time travels.

Good Luck !
