## Background Story & Description

In a world where scientists are performing more and more tests on Time Travel. A group of scientists decided to try to educate
some monkeys to make them the test subjects of their experiences on Time Travelling technologies.
In order to prepare them for time travels, these scientists had to teach them how to, at least, recognize their environement and the timeline they are located in.

To do that, they called us, a bunch of weird devs, to make applications to teach them how to recognize environments and timelines based only on visual informations.

We, then, made two applications, a web one and a mobile one.
